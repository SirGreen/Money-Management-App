i am making an app including these features, i need to create a presentation to talk about the app in 8 minutes, using japanese, i am working for a company named TNS株式会社 for an internship period from june to 9th august. 

about the presentation structure: it shall has this title "TNS株式会社でインターンシップのレポート" and be splited into 2 parts: about interhip and about the developing app during the intership
- about intership (3 minutes) will include a slide talking about myself: my name is フィン・ミン・コア i am from vietnam, 3rd year student majoring in computer sience at ho chi minh city university of technology, and my decision for taking up the intership in japan is because i have loved and want to explore more deeply about japan's culture, people, worklife and living condition. and a slide talking about the intership: people in the company's very kind, supportive, i got treated to a welcome meal, a meal to get to know more about company people and a goodbye meal; special thanks to sasaki, saeki, inoue, fellicia, itou, fujiyama and ayaka for giving me feedback, teach me about working culture as well as life in japan, as well as many other things that made this journey more memorable to me.

■ 日本とベトナムの共通点と相違点
日本とベトナムの共通点としては、どちらも他人に対する思いやりを大切にする文化があると思います。例えば、公共の場では静かにすることや、人に迷惑をかけないように気をつける点が似ています。

一方で、相違点として感じたのは、時間に対する意識です。日本では約束の時間をきちんと守ることがとても重要視されていて、5分前行動が当たり前という文化があります。ベトナムではもう少し柔軟な面もあると思いました。

■ 日本で初めて体験したもの
日本で初めて体験したことは、花火大会に行ったことです。日本の花火大会は規模が大きく、とても美しくて感動しました。浴衣を着た人たちや、屋台の雰囲気も新鮮で、日本ならではの夏の文化を体験できたと思います。

また、コンビニの便利さにも驚きました。24時間営業で、食事から支払いまで何でもできる点は、非常に便利だと感じました。

■ ベトナムの家族や友達に購入したお土産紹介
家族には、日本のお菓子やお茶、特に抹茶味のお菓子を買いました。ベトナムではなかなか手に入らない味なので、きっと喜んでくれると思います。

友達には、東京限定のキャラクターグッズや、キーホルダー、文房具などを買いました。デザインがかわいくて、日本らしいお土産として人気があると思いました。

■ インターンを通して学んだこと
今回のインターンを通して、実際の開発現場でのチームワークの大切さや、細かい部分まで丁寧に作り込む姿勢を学びました。日本の職場では、品質に対するこだわりが強く、それがユーザーの満足につながっていることを実感しました。

また、毎日の報告やコミュニケーションの中で、日本語での表現力も向上し、自分の考えをわかりやすく伝える力がついたと思います。
